    <h3>Unity, Mirror, Networking</h3>
    <p>I chose this topic because it is something of great interest to me.  With this Web API class, there is a big chance to get back into working with Mirror networking and unity.  As well as to solidify my understanding of many networking concepts
        and how to build different applications in different frameworks such as using NodeJS and the REST API.  The ability to write games in unity that have networked capabilities is one of my main goals as many of my game plans require this. 
        As well as the majority of the games that hold my interest are online in some form.  The use of mirror networking package and Unity has seen some great success in certain modern games, most notably Population One, a game I have played quite a lot.
        My goal over the next several weeks is to reintroduce myself to mirror networking and begin building a set of frameworks for various game formats that I can use to learn new things as well as create my own unity package to use as a starting point.
